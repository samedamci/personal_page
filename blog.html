        <h2>Why Manjaro sucks?</h2>
        Oh, this is hard and complex topic. If you use Manjaro please, don't worry about.
        This is my personal opinion, you don't have to accept it. So... Manjaro have too much
        unnecessary applications by default, why? Are people can't install needed programs
        itself? Who need program named "fire" which showing f*cking fire in the window? I think
        nobody... Even if exists man who need, he can install it but why this is in all
        fresh installations by default? Anyway, that isn't only one disadvantage of ManjarNO.
        Second is update policy. Manjaro is based on Arch Linux which is rolling release and
        this is no problem. Problem is because Manjaro isn't true rolling. What? Yes, Manjaro isn't
        true rolling... It have also "stable" versions like Ubuntu or Debian but Manjaro <b>isn't stable</b>.
        Also rolling model is backward by several days or sometimes weeks from upstream.
        Arch is much more stable than Manjaro. So what you should use if you using Manjaro?
        If you are newbie in Linux world you can try one of Ubuntu flavours or Debian.
        Debian is really cool distro, isn't hard and don't have snaps like Ubuntu
        which are terrible slow. But if you are more advanced user try Arch - you won't regret
        or if you really want to have installer you can use EndeavourOS which is Arch based
        distro with simple installer and without bloat like Manjaro have.
