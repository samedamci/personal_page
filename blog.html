        People often don't understand users of Free Software. Certain
        persons think that using only open apps and services is masochism. I don't understand
        them. Free Software opens to you much more advantages than you think, foremost freedom.
        You can modify application to your personal preferences, you are not addicted to software
        developer. You might think if you aren't "technical" person you will not use this option
        but you are wrong. Every developer can fork application and add new features which
        you can use. Software is developed in team of users from all the world. This is
        awesome.</br></br>
        Other advantage of FOSS is privacy. When you (or any developer) can watch source code
        of application there is no way to hide in it spyware and even if somebody does that will
        very soon come to light. But why you should worry about privacy on the web? „I have nothing
        to hide” you can tell. Really? So send to me your credit card data. You are doing it if you
        use Google Pay or something like that so why you can't send these informations for me? Are you
        trust Google more than random people from internet? But why? This is the same thing, you probably
        don't know anybody of Google's team so why you share with it your data? We know that Google sell
        your data to advertisers, but what will happens if one day big database with informations about
        millions users will leak? This is very probably and even that big software giant can have
        „bad day”... All your data outside your control. Someone who intercepts this data can do
        with it everything he wants. Have you ever wondered about that?</br></br>
        „Ok but I must use some proprietary apps because FOSS alternatives are bad.”
        This is specified only of few specialist applications for photographs or music creators. If
        you are casual user of computer I think FOSS alternatives are all you need for be happy.
        </br></br>
        If I convinced you to take an interest in Free Software you can look out on

        <a href="#2"><h2><p class="wt">#2</p> Why Manjaro sucks?</h2></a>
        Oh, this is hard and complex topic. If you use Manjaro please, don't worry about.
        This is my personal opinion, you don't have to accept it. So... Manjaro have too much
        unnecessary applications by default, why? Can't people install needed programs
        itself? Who need program named "fire" which showing f*cking fire in the window? I think
        nobody... Even if exists man who need, he can install it but why this is in all
        fresh installations by default? Anyway, that isn't only one disadvantage of ManjarNO.
        Second is update policy. Manjaro is based on Arch Linux which is rolling release and
        this is no problem. Problem is because Manjaro isn't true rolling. What? Yes, Manjaro isn't
        true rolling... It have also "stable" versions like Ubuntu or Debian but Manjaro <b>isn't stable</b>.
        Also rolling model is backward by several days or sometimes weeks from upstream.
        Arch is much more stable than Manjaro. So what you should use if you using Manjaro?
        If you are newbie in Linux world you can try one of Ubuntu flavours or Debian.
        Debian is really cool distro, isn't hard and don't have snaps like Ubuntu
        which are terrible slow. But if you are more advanced user try Arch - you won't regret
        or if you really want to have installer you can use EndeavourOS which is Arch based
        distro with simple installer and without bloat like Manjaro have.
